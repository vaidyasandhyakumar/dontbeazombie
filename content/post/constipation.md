## Introduction
Everyone has a day when we held our tummies with an irritating mind because our bowles just wont empty. But for some others, its the way they live,
A part of their routine. So, Is it actually normal? And to the people who dont exactly know, What constipation is lets understand whats it all
about.

- Heaviness in the abdomen, with slight pain.
- Bloating (Feeling that abdomen has increased in size)
- Inability to pass stools, sometimes passes partially.
- May or may not have gas.
- On the long run, it maybe witnessed as emptying of bowels once in 2 or 3 days or more.

## Remedies
### Ghee (Clarified butter)
- Use when stools feel hard and dry
- When constipation is due to overeating of dry foods(like bread) or dry beverages(like 
soda or alcohol)
- Constipation in old age
Dosage: 2 tsp in half glass of hot water to be drunk before every meal, it is always advisable to have Ghee mixed with diet as
a part of our lifestyle.

### Butter
- It is better for people who genrally tend to overheat.
- It is cooler than Ghee, hence it is to be cautiosly taken in people with digestive problems.
Dosage: one tsp full in half a glass of hot water, to be drunk before every meal or sip along with the meal.

### Jaggery
- Use in case of stubborn constipation, when the hunger is slightly lesser or normal.
Dosage: Boil about 50 grams of Jaggery in water, drink this water with or without ghee before meals. Ghee gives an added effect.

### Haritaki (Harad in hindi, chebulic myrobalan in english)
- If the constipation has been on and off since many days
- Uneasiness with pain, loss of appitite and heaviness of abdomen.
Dosage: One tsp of Haritaki powder in one glass of hot water with or without Ghee can be taken for one week before bed time.
Ghee gives an added effect

### Castor oil
-  In case of extremely stubborn constipation
- If the constipation is extending for more than 4 or 5 days.
Dosage: two tsp in one glass of hot water before bed time. Do not take for more than 2 days.

> If constipation is associated with extreme loss of appetite, then wait for the hunger to return. Consume sips of hot water in between because in this case constipation is because of indigestion and not because mere obstruction or dry stools.

> In children, Do not use castor oil instead regular use of ghee is very effective. In old age, constipation is a common problem. Use ghee for the same.

## Lets dig deeper!
According to ayurveda, there is a saying which says fat is one of the most essential components required for life. 
### Reason
- Dry foods and drinks
- Change in weather, place and food habits.
- Controlling urges(of faeces and gas).
- Inappropriate eating habits and lifestyle.
- Spicy/Bitter food.

Biologically speaking, our body is made of approximately  60% of water. and we still drink a large quantity of it. But it is not 
actually required. When our body is running out of water, it indidcates to us through the feeling of thirst.

So, what is the role of water in constipation? Does drinking large quantity of water reduce the occurence of constipation? Answer is No. 
Water consumed with food only helps in mixing the food well during digestion, but not in the evacuation of faeces, as it is reabsorbed
by the large intestines. All the extra water will only dilute the digestive enzymes resulting in a poor digestion and appitite. This 
reabsorbed water travel to the kidneys and get filtered out as urine. Solution is fat.

Just like oil lubricates an old rusted engine and helps it work again, fat helps lubricate the bowels. Fats dont dry out like water
and are digested but not reabsorbed. So, the best forms of fat to be consumed are ghee and butter as they have higher amounts of 
monounsaturated fatty acids which increase the synthesis of high density lipo proteins(HDL) which is also good for the heart. 
High fibre diet will only increase the quantity of faeces produced, but again for its easy evacuation. Fat is a Must.
