In this part, let us look into some techniques for boosting immunity for the short term and on the long term.

### Short term practices:

* Chewing 3-4 leaves of tulasi
* Drinking warm milk with turmeric, pepper and sugar
* Chewing finely chopped ginger pieces with salt just before every meal
* Fruits like amla, pomegranate, papaya, sapota, raisins, almond, oranges, sweet lime
* Drumstick fruit or leaf sambar/ porridge

### Long term practices:

* Wake up at the same time everyday preferably by 6am. Sleep early, at the same time everyday to get adequate sleep.
* Brush regularly, thoroughly, so as to clean all the nooks and corners of the mouth. Later, do clean the tongue to get rid of the coating.
* **Oil pulling/ Kavala:** Take about 5-10 ml of any oil which you usually use (coconut oil/ gingelly oil is preferred). Indirectly heat it by keeping it in warm water. Then gargle the oil in the mouth thoroughly for about 2-3 mins and spit out and  rinse the mouth with warm water.  
  _The benefits of this procedure are as follows:_
  * This will clear all the residual pathogens, increase the oral and throat immunity
  * Protect the oral mucous membrane from any cuts or tears
  * Makes the salivary gland openings patent and active
  * Improves perception of taste
  * Strengthens sense organs of the head
* **Oil bath/ Abhyanga:** Should be done regularly with any oil which is used regularly (coconut oil or till oil is suitable). About 10-20 ml of oil (or as per requirement) is taken in a cup and heated indirectly on hot water. The warm oil is applied to the body in a downward direction and in circular motion at the joints. This has to be done exclusively on the feet, earlobes and head. The head is like the CPU of the body, constantly coordinating and processing a number of tasks and thoughts. Therefore it is important to maintain the head at a lower temperature.  
  While oiling the head, the hair doesn't have to be completely oiled. Instead, apply the oil onto the scalp by gently massaging with the fingertips.  
  _The benefits of this procedure are as follows:_
  * By massaging the earlobes, a gush of blood can be felt to the head and scalp region, relaxing the mind and body.
  * Massaging the feel especially at bedtime yields sound sleep and a feeling of freshness in the mornings.
  * This process of oil bath restores immunity at the level of the skin.
  * It moisturises the skin and maintains it soft and supple.
  * Skin cracks are prevented and hence a continuous barrier is formed from the pathogens.
  * The process also improves blood circulation throughout the body and helps  in eliminating toxins through the skin.
  * The immune glands of the skin stay healthy.
  * This procedure also helps one stay warm.
  * It also improves eyesight, improves joint stability and muscle activity.
  * It serves as an excellent anti ageing regimen.
  * Improves digestion and metabolism and promotes coordination between that various systems of the body.
  * Reduces risk of developing certain grave diseases of the nervous system like nerve palsy, degeneration, etc
* Taking regular bath also increases the metabolism at all levels. It improves hunger, vigour and circulation. It cleanses the skin of all the dirt and makes the gland openings patent. But one needs to make sure that warm/hot water is not used to the head and neck region as that suddenly increases blood flow to the brain and eyes and may cause bleeds from the small blood vessels which may be fatal, result in paralysis or blindness.
* **Nasya:** It is the process in which medicine is instilled into the nostrils in the form of oil or kashaya. The same oil which is used for oil bath can be used for nasya too. The oil is indirectly warmed and can be drawn using a dropper or simply by dipping the finger into the oil. With the head tilted backwards, preferably lying down on a firm surface, 2 drops of the oil is instilled into each of the nostrils. It is also good to gently apply the insides of the nostrils with the oil remaining on the finger. The oil will gradually flow down the nostrils to the throat, and on reaching the throat the oil has to be spat out. Further, warm water has to be gargled.  
  _The benefits of this procedure are as follows:_
  * This procedure forms a barrier at the level of the nasal epithelium, preventing the entry of pathogens.
  * It increases the blood flow to the region and helps in providing ready immune cells to the region.
  * This reduces allergic reactions, benefiting people who frequently suffer from allergies due to pollen, dust and so on.
  * It also has curative effects on long standing cases of sinus infections and other diseases related to the  nose.
  * The part of the nose which has sensory nerve endings is directly related to the central nervous system, the brain. These nerves travel directly to the brain. And hence the effect of the medicine instilled, will reach the brain and provide protection to the central nervous system also.
  * As the central nervous is related to the sense organs, it is also beneficial to all the sense organs in the head region.
  * It also helps in relieving long standing diseases of the  head like migraine, etc.
* **Method of consuming food:**
  * Consume food which is warm and light to digest.
  * Include 2 spoons of ghee with every meal.
  * Eat only when hungry.
  * Eat at the same time everyday to set a routine for the body.
  * Assume that the stomach is divided into 4 parts. While consuming food, 1/2 part of the quantity of the stomach should contain solid food, 1/4th liquid and  the remaining 1/4 should be left free for the adequate movement of food particles in the stomach.
  * Avoid raw food - salads, or partially cooked food, as they do not contain the right chemical structure that can be digested and assimilated in the gut of humans. Hence they may result in problems like indigestion, bloating, etc. and may lead to more serious diseases on the long run.
  * Avoid consuming sprouts as they contain excess enzymes as they are in a state of active growth. These enzymes affect the digestion leading to may metabolic disturbances.
  * Cook and eat with a pleasant mind.
  * Consume fruits _before_ a meal.
  * Avoid excess usage of curd, especially at night. Use buttermilk instead.
  * Eat fruits only which are seasonal as they naturally grow according to the seasons for which there is a benefit.
  * Consuming fruits which are grown indigenously is recommended as they are ideal in providing the right kind of nutrition for the population of that geographical and climatic region.
  * Do not consume food immediately after exercise or heavy work.
  * Do not take bath after you eat or drink anything, wait for 1-1.5 hrs until you bathe. Or instead, bathe and then eat.
  * Do not sleep after a meal or in the daytime. The process of digestion takes about 6-8 hours to complete. So once we consume breakfast, till the next morning there is continuous digestion happening in the digestive tract. When one sleeps during the day, the brain relaxes and the blood flow is redirected to the digestive tract resulting in excess production of digestive juices, resulting in bloating, indigestion, problems in absorption, etc. This again leads to many metabolic disturbances on the long run.
  * Do not eat frequently. Changes in meal routine is usually advised for people who have major problems with digestion and absorption. Frequent feeding for normal healthy individuals will result in inconsistencies in the digested food. It is similar to adding raw rice to a vessel of rice already cooking. Hence some parts of the digested food is denatured due to over exposure to the digestive juices and some of it undigested due to less exposure. This hampers the absorption of the right kind of nutrient molecules required for the body.
  * Eating hot and cold things alternatively will also yield a similar outcome as the concentration and nature of the digestive juices changes frequently throughout the process due to the variation in temperature.
* **How to drink water the right way:**
  * Drink water sip by sip along with the meal and not before or after a meal. This will ensure the food is mixed well for digestion. Drinking before or after the meal will dilute the digestive juices and make digestion sluggish.
  * Drink boiled water as it enhances taste and digestion. Helps improve circulation in the mouth and throat  and hence provides ready immunity.
  * Drink water only when thirsty. The body has a mechanism of thirst for expressing the need for water. Drinking water more than what the body requires will burden the kidneys to filter more than the usual amount of water. It will also cause fulid overload in the system.
  * The popular concept of "water flushing out toxins" doesn't quite fit as the water still passes through a stringent filter- the kidneys, which reabsorb any molecule which cannot pass through its filter. If it only were that simple!
  * The concept of drinking excess water eases bowel movement is also a flawed as the excess water is in fact reabsorbed in the large intestine and the so called lubrication effect is not delivered.
  * Excess water like I said above, hampers digestion and causes abnormal bowel habits.
  * The concept of skin health being attributed to water is also not apt as the excess water does not reach the skin, but instead is being filtered out through the kidneys. What in fact is necessary for the maintenance of good skin is consuming food in the right way so that the right nutrients are absorbed from the intestine and reach the skin through the blood.
  * Drinking excess water hampers not only digestion but also tissue metabolism resulting in the formation of less, excess or abnormal cells at various levels (which also include immune cells.)
* Avoid travelling in cold, windy weathers. If inevitable, wear warm clothes and cover the ears. Keep warm in general. Warmth increases blood circulation to the periphery and keeps immunity working throughout the body. During exposure to cold weather, the blood flow is redirected to the central vital organs to protect the core temperature and functionality. This deficit in peripheral blood circulation will reduce the number of circulating immune cells. Further, the skin may crack  or become scaly and give way for infections.
* **_Never mix honey with warm water._** This forms toxic chemical products which accumulate in the body and lead to many complications.
* Maintain regular personal hygiene- cutting nails, trimming hair, menstrual hygiene, etc
* **Keep the mind pleasant by:**
  * Cultivating hobbies
  * Taking short breaks between tedious tasks
  * Talking to people in times of need
  * Spending quality time with family, friends or pets.
  * Playing outdoor sports
  * Yoga/ any form of exercise
  * Simple meditation techniques
  * Solving fun puzzles
  * Getting adequate sleep, sleeping and waking up at the same time everyday. This sets the natural body rhythm right and helps in releasing hormones which help in the harmonious functioning of various systems of the body.
  * Helping people in need.
  * Prayers
* **Keeping the environment healthy:**
  * Lighting incense sticks.
  * Adding some disinfecting agents like neem, turmeric, tulsi, etc along with the incense.
  * Diffusing essential oils like lavender, basil, sandalwood, etc
  * Use essential oils to was regular wear, masks, surroundings, etc
  * Cultivate medicinal plants
  * Cleaning the workplace/ house regularly to avoid accumulation of dust and to avoid visual clutter for maximum productivity.
  * Playing pleasant music/ prayers
  * Avoid burning leaves or any other garbage as they form toxic fumes

That being said, I have tried to summarize the main points regarding how immunity can be acquired by simple modifications in lifestyle according to the core principles of Ayurveda. This will help us establish a good immunity and fight any disease with ease in the future.
