# The Why?

The world is getting lazier and less self caring day by day and the western culture and industrial revolution seemed to accelerate the process. In "developing" ourselves, we have lost connection with our inner self. And every day we are moving away from what we truly are. Ayurveda shows how to best live our short life with hapiness and completeness. But the mediums of teaching ayurveda are limited and usually tend to have a very high entry barrier. In a quest to solve this, we are creating a website in which we explain most of the ayurvedic topics in simple language so that everyone can understand how it works.

# The Who?

Hello! I am Dr.Sandhya. My close friend and myself are in a quest to make ayurveda available to the masses and this is the first quantifiable step we are taking to make our dreams a reality.

### Come join us on this exploration of life, peace and purpose!
